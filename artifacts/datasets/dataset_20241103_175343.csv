4,"The earbuds perform very well for this price range. It comes with ANC, Dual device connectivity, App support and various modes for personalised experience like noise cancellation modes (ANC, Normal, Transparent), Spatial audio, Dynamic mode, Bass adjustment and game mode as well.For the detailed part-Noise Cancellation: It works just fine. It cancels out noise from fans, coolers and other equipment and also noise from cars and bikes to an extent. Although I hear a shrill shushing sound while noise is being cancelled.Battery: I use the buds at high-moderate usage. The battery lasts for 5-6 hours for the buds and 3-4 days for the case. So, two charges in a week are fine.Connectivity: The buds do sometimes have abnormalities in connections like breakage in voice while in dual connection mode and sometimes but I think it gets better with passage of time.Fit: They fit good into ears but be sure to use right sized eartips. I had to go a size smaller for my ears when normal ones started to pain and discomfort.Colour and finish: It comes with a glossy finish so be ready for lots of scratches. Other than than build quality is nice.Touch controls: They provide customisable touch controls through realme link app for double tap, triple tap, touch and hold for each earbud for next track, previous track, voice assistant, ANC modes and volume control as well. Although, I feel the app could be improved.Mic: From what I have heard from the receivers, the mics work just fine. They also cancel external noise to an extent.Voice Clarity: The voice comes up to be clear and sound. The app provides features to adjust the frequencies, bass and other parameters.Overall, its a good-to-go purchase and I would recommend it for 1.5-2k price range.",An All-rounder in this segment.

4,"First day feedback:a) Sound quality: The sound quality is amazing ! feels way more premium than the earlier pair I had (Blaupunkt). noise cancellation is very good. Bass is normal - but the mid tones and music shines through.b) Charging case ergonomics: The device charging case lacks an indicator of the level of the battery (which Blaupunkt had). So you dont know when you need to keep it for charging.c) The serious gripe I had with this was the cumbersome process of setting up dual pairing (which is advertized on Amazon page - but a feature which is not mentioned in the user manual!) Good news is that it works! bad news is that you will probably need to try different combinations of pairing and unpairing your laptop and phone to get it rightly paired. once paired, it works alright.. when faced with connectivity issue, just switch off and on the bluetooth, and it should work on the mobile.overall, I am satisfied and would recommend it @ 1,499.",Excellent sound quality - but a pain to set up dual devices,0

The slide to control volume was the reason I chose this over other TWS buds in this price range. The build quality of the case could have been better, the lid is moving slightly and is not firm.I've been facing a bug since yesterday, sometimes both the buds glitch out and sound very robotic for about a second, then the sound comes from only one bud left or right alternately. Then it becomes normal, but there is a distinct lag in sound, the latency increases quite a bit, to about 1-1.5 seconds. Today it's gotten worse, happened more than 3-4 times.Don't know whether anyone else is facing these.","Good, but nothing special",0

4,"I‚Äôm a big fan of headphones‚Äîsome might even call it an obsession. Since this is one of my favorite areas in electronics, expect a detailed review.Before diving in, I believe in establishing benchmarks, as comparing products helps assess their performance effectively.I own at least one headphone from every category‚Äînot meant as a brag, but to highlight my passion for varied content consumption.So, why did I choose these?It was a tough choice between the Oppo Enco Buds 2 and these, with the main differences being price and some features. Ultimately, I opted for these because for just a little more, I get IP55 rating and a larger driver.That said, a larger driver doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean better sound.Previously, I was using Skullcandy Spoke, which many enthusiasts might recognize as quite muted. You have to crank the volume above 70% to catch all the details, and they‚Äôre nearly inaudible outdoors. So even if the OnePlus turns out to be a poor choice, at least I won't be stuck with earbuds that lack volume.Likes:Excellent design‚Äîsturdy and not flimsy.Good sound quality for the price.Long battery life, though not the best in class.Stem design looks nice and fits snugly.Quick switch feature is a plus.Dislikes:Missing features like a functional game mode and volume controls on the earbuds.Accidental touches when putting them on or taking them off‚Äînot a deal-breaker, but common in the industry.Concern about losing the buds during physical activities.More customization options in the app would be appreciated.Strangely, the large ear tips fit worse than the medium ones, even though I used the larger tips with my OnePlus neckband.",Best buds for your ear with standard quality,0

4,"I love the sound. It's rich and strong, and has really good bass. I am an audiophile and I find most earphones/buds/headphones that people use, not 'good enough'. I'm that particular about audio, just like that. This one checks all the boxes at least at the price point. The sound quality is really good. The bass and the clarity or vocals and strings, etc... is on point.HOWEVER, DO NOT UPDATE FIRMWARE. The moment I connected it to my phone I got a firmware update. I did, and I had grains/noice in the audio all the time. I thought of getting a replacement, but I tried resetting the buds and viola! The noice was gone, and everything was perfect.I recommend not turning on any additional settings, just LDAC if you want.ANC- really good. Personally not a fan of ANC in general, but if you like it, yeah, these buds do a decent job.Really good battery backup, I use it less because on my laptop I use headphones (Razer Blackshark V2X, which is mind-blowing good by the way!). One single case charge would last me a week I think.It's not very comfortable. It doesn't stay secure in the ears, it'll keep taking off, and ears will pain after a while.","Amazing Sound, and Battery backup, NOT COMFORTABLE or Secure",0

4,"This is an in-depth review of the samsung galaxy buds 2 pro. At the time of this review they are on sale for 6.4k with bank offers. The real question is are they still worth it for this price (the best low price I've seen them at)?Well the short answer is yes if you are getting it at the deal price and may not be worth to everyone if the price is above 10k. It has it own strengths and weaknesses. Do read this lengthy review which I hope will help people decide properly and not just jump at it looking at the deal price thinking they will get the best flagship tws from samsung.First things first, the moment you connect the buds 2 pro to your android phone, if that phone is a mid range phone like the samsung m series or an A series then don't expect a magically transformed music experience. You will need to set the eq mode from the galaxy wearable app to dynamic to get the best from the tws( this was my personal preference and others may want to play with eq) but without eq adjustment they might not sound awesome on mid range phones.Connect them to a decent high end phone like Samsung Galaxy S series(you get complete 24 bit audio) or One plus 12 etc which support high and best resolution audio codecs, you will feel the true worth of these earphones.If you are a hard core bass lover where you want an extreme thump for all the types of music you hear then you may feel a little disappointed. The bass is definitely there but there are other headphones/tws for the extreme bass lovers. I personally tested this against One plus buds z2, One plus buds pro 2 and one plus buds 3 (the usual popular choices) and I felt for a basshead, one plus tws are much more suited but they lack in voice and instrument clarity a little.I could not test with realme air pro 6 and oppo enco x2 but I can tell from previous experience that the buds 2 pro fare better than them both and not just because this was last generation's flagship tws from samsung.The voice clarity and instruments sound a lot more realistic and full on the buds 2 pro. Very very close to apple air pods pro 2(apple still has a better edge).The design is extremely comfortable to me. This I feel is again subjective as some might feel them to be painful. I could simply sleep wearing them without any pain. Extremely snug fitActive noise cancellation is very decent, close to Sony's and apple flagship tws. For folks trying this for the first time or expecting to try noise cancellation on a flagship tws, don't expect complete zero noise from environment, it cuts most of it.Dolby atmos, 360 audio and head tracking. Dolby Atmos does make a significant difference. 360 audio with and without head tracking sounds amazing when watching videos. Netflix content will sound superb. For music just the eq at dynamic was more than sufficient. Using 360 for music was not very overwhelming, I felt it was just meh. But how to get the best of it, if you are using a mid range phone ditch Spotify and get apple music with lossless audio to get the best out this pair of tws for music. Amazon music and Airtel music were just meh. The tws shine the most on apple music as it supports proper Dolby Atmos codecs with lossless audio. For mid range phones that don't support high res audio this is a game changer. On high end phones the music quality is just awesome.Battery life, it took half hour for full charge and lasted close to 4hours 55 min with ANC on. I'm expetic close to 7 and half or 8 without ANC but then they sound best with ANC on. Overall moderate not amazing but not bad either.AI features, you need compatible samsung phones to get them to work(live language translation and transcribing).Overall they are a solid set of tws and definitely live upto the name of flagship tws. A perfect balance of sound clarity and bass. Mediocre battery, could have been better if they supported multi-point connectivity.",Galaxy buds 2 pro are they worth it?,0

5,"Review: Impressive Sound and Comfort at a Great Price!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êI've been using the Noise N1 Pro headphones for a few weeks now, and they've genuinely exceeded my expectations, especially considering their affordable price. Here's my breakdown:Sound Quality:The audio clarity is fantastic with a well-balanced mix of bass, mids, and highs. The bass is punchy but not overpowering, which is great for someone like me who listens to a variety of music genres. While it doesn't offer top-tier noise-canceling like premium models, the noise isolation is decent enough in quieter environments, allowing for an immersive experience.Comfort & Fit:These are some of the most comfortable headphones I've used. The lightweight design and soft ear cups are a dream for long listening sessions. Even after wearing them for hours, I never experienced any discomfort or ear fatigue‚Äîa huge plus for me. They also fit snugly without being too tight.Battery Life:The battery life is where these really shine. I'm consistently getting around 60 hours of playback on a single charge. This makes them perfect for long trips or simply forgetting to charge them without worrying about running out of power.Design & Build:The design is sleek and minimalistic, with a foldable structure that makes them easy to carry around. While the headphones are primarily made of plastic, they feel sturdy and well-constructed, not cheap at all.Overall, if you're looking for high-quality headphones at a budget-friendly price, the Noise N1 Pro is a solid choice. Whether for everyday listening or extended use, they deliver in both sound and comfort!","Sound,Comfort,Connectivity",0

5,"Samsung Galaxy Buds2 ReviewThe Samsung Galaxy Buds2 are a solid choice for wireless earbuds, offering a balance of comfort, performance, and value, especially for Samsung Galaxy device users. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the pros and cons:Design and ComfortThe Galaxy Buds2 are sleek, compact, and lightweight, making them comfortable for long listening sessions. They come with three different sizes of silicone ear tips, allowing users to find the right fit for both comfort and noise isolation. The rounded design fits snugly in the ear and stays in place even during workouts or long commutes.Pros:Compact and lightweight designComfortable for extended wearSecure fit, suitable for light exerciseAvailable in multiple colorsSound QualityThe sound quality on the Galaxy Buds2 is impressive for their price. The earbuds have a well-balanced sound profile with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The audio is tuned by AKG, a subsidiary of Samsung known for its audio expertise. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature works well to block out background noise, making them suitable for noisy environments like public transportation or crowded spaces.Pros:Balanced sound with deep bassActive Noise CancellationClear audio for calls and media consumptionCons:No customization of sound without a Samsung deviceBattery LifeThe battery life on the Galaxy Buds2 is decent but not outstanding. The earbuds provide around 5 hours of playback with ANC on and 7.5 hours without ANC. The charging case adds an additional 15 hours of battery life, which is enough for a full day of use. Fast charging provides about an hour of playtime from just a 5-minute charge, which is convenient.Pros:Adequate battery life with ANC offWireless charging supportCons:Average battery life with ANC on (around 5 hours)Features and ConnectivityThe Galaxy Buds2 come with a host of features, especially if you're using them with a Samsung Galaxy device. They support seamless pairing with Samsung devices, and the Galaxy Wearable app allows for customization of touch controls, equalizer settings, and more. They also support 360 Audio for a more immersive sound experience, though this feature is mainly beneficial for users with Samsung devices running One UI 3.1 or later.Pros:Easy pairing with Samsung devicesCustomizable touch controls via app360 Audio support for immersive sound (Samsung users)Automatic device switching between Samsung productsCons:Some advanced features are limited to Samsung Galaxy usersNo Bluetooth multipoint (can‚Äôt connect to two devices at once)Noise Cancellation and Ambient ModeThe Active Noise Cancellation on the Buds2 is effective but not top-tier like on premium models (e.g., Galaxy Buds Pro or Apple AirPods Pro). It reduces background noise but might not completely block out loud environments. The Ambient Mode allows external sounds in when needed, which is useful for conversations or when being aware of surroundings is important.Pros:Effective ANC for its price rangeConvenient Ambient Mode for conversations or awarenessCons:ANC performance isn‚Äôt the best for very noisy environmentsCall QualityThe Galaxy Buds2 provide clear call quality, aided by 3 microphones and a Voice Pickup Unit (VPU). Wind and noise reduction work reasonably well, ensuring your voice comes through clearly during phone or video calls.Pros:Clear call qualityGood wind and noise reduction for callsPriceAt around $149 (or less during sales), the Samsung Galaxy Buds2 are competitively priced, especially considering their features like ANC and seamless integration with Samsung‚Äôs ecosystem.ConclusionThe Samsung Galaxy Buds2 are a great mid-range option for users looking for good sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and solid integration with the Samsung ecosystem. While they‚Äôre not the best for users outside the Samsung Galaxy environment, they‚Äôre an excellent choice for those within it.Rating: 8.5/10Who should buy it?Samsung Galaxy users who want seamless connectivityThose looking for affordable wireless earbuds with ANCPeople who prioritize comfort and a lightweight designWho might pass?Users who need top-tier ANC performanceThose outside the Samsung ecosystem who want maximum feature compatibility",Good quality,0

1,"The product is underwhelming; the right earphone produces significantly less sound than the left, even with the equalizer adjusted. Additionally, the overall sound quality remains poor despite maximizing the volume on the phone.",New Product  is not up to the mark,1
1,I bought this for 4.5k in July and currently it's retailing at 3k on Amazon which should give you idea how bad this product is.JBL has a super confusing and mixed models line up when it comes to TWS and on top of that you will always see moxed model/country reviews on Amazon on all its products.In merely 2 month of use I had to visit the service centre as sometimes right or sometimes left earpiece wasn't charging and the connectivity issue was at par. Even if you close the buds in case they won't get disconnected which is super frustrating.On top of all these issues the core aspect of earphones ie Sound Quality is also not at all satisfactory and has a super low volume.I got a replacement with similar issues still persisting here and there.Regret buying this JBL TWS (My first and last). Big time disappointment as I bought this out of likeliness to my experience of Tune 230 NC at a Samsung store.,High Expectations - Pathetic Product,1

1,I have had 4 products of JBL in the past and got these earpods as the 5th which cost 6k but it isn't even worth 1K... sound quality was ok...but it started giving battery issues very soon (dies in half hour)... service centre cleans and gives but they hv no idea what the problem is... And they say since I went to them 20 days after warranty is over they can't do anything about it...they don't expect a 6k earpods to work more than a year...and the earpods replacement would cost around 5k with a RIDICULOUS one month warranty...I went back to using my old BOAT earpods which cost 2k and they are still working perfectly even after 3 years...Also Amazon had sent these JBL earpods which were registered in someone else's name when i received them...they were not in factory reset which I got done by service centre... Amazon claims the box was sealed so brand new... JBL store feels they seal all returned products without solving the issue..I don't know who is at fault more but JBL is certainly WORST AFTER SERVICE and Amazon CANNOT BE RELIED UPON FOR EXPERIENCE ELECTRONIC PURCHASE,Worst JBL experience!,1

4,"In nearly every aspect, this TWS performs exceptionally well for its budget segment. However, it may cause slight discomfort in the ear when worn for extended periods or while lying on one's side. The active noise cancellation (ANC) is effective, though not the best available, and the sound quality is commendable. It is believed that the performance might be enhanced when used with a OnePlus phone. Overall, it is a good TWS option.",A little uncomfortable in ear.,1
4,"I recently purchased the Realme Buds T300 TWS earbuds, and overall, I am quite satisfied with the product. The 40-hour playtime is impressive, and the 30dB active noise cancellation (ANC) works well in blocking out background noise, making it great for both music and calls. The sound quality is clear, and the bass is punchy without being overwhelming. The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the touch controls are responsive.However, I did notice that the noise cancellation could be slightly improved in extremely noisy environments, and the case, while sleek, feels a bit delicate. That being said, these are minor issues, and the earbuds offer excellent value for the price.

Has two modes and ANC is to kill for! I think that's the only reason I went back to my this the second time. Battery life is decent.

4,The sound quality is great. I do a lot of calls & this is comfortable to wear & do calls with.

4,"I would like to start by saying that it may take a while to adjust with these if you're coming from realme, boat etc. The reason behind this is the sound signature. These are not ""bass boosted"" earbuds that I was used to. They're very balanced and provide an amazing audio experience. Only downside I would say is slightly poor battery life. But the possible reason could be ANC. It's not fast charging like other brands but it's not terribly slow either. Only buy these during offers.",Pretty fantastic product,1

You can feel yourself being immersed in the music.Features: It gives you touch controls , along with a loooottt of features in the settings or in the HeyMelody app. Here you can control the drivers to your liking and also they provide you with custom tools so as to fit your beat !Overall , I must say , if you want some good music experience and a quieter environment , go for it.

I recently purchased the Boult earbuds, and they have exceeded my expectations in every way. The sound quality is truly impressive, delivering deep bass, crisp mids, and clear highs. Whether I'm listening to music or taking calls, the audio is rich and immersive, with no distortion even at higher volumes.In terms of comfort, these earbuds are lightweight and ergonomically designed, fitting snugly without causing any discomfort during extended use. They stay securely in place, making them ideal for workouts or long commutes. The noise isolation feature is excellent, allowing for a focused listening experience even in noisy environments.The battery life is another standout feature. With hours of playtime on a single charge, I rarely need to recharge throughout the day, and the charging case adds an extra layer of convenience.For anyone in the market for high-quality earbuds, I would highly recommend the Boult buds.

5,"I've been thoroughly enjoying my Realme Buds Air 5 Pro since the day I purchased them! These earbuds have become my daily companions for watching movies, listening to music, and more. The sound quality is outstanding, especially the spatial sound feature, which provides an immersive experience like no other.I've worn them for extended periods without any discomfort or ear fatigue. While the bass could be slightly improved, the in-app settings allow for adjustments to enhance the low-end frequency. Although my Oppo earbuds have better bass, I still prefer the Realme Air 5 Pro for its balanced sound signature, with perfect mids, highs, and lows.The noise cancellation and transparency modes work seamlessly, and the Golden Sound feature is a game-changer! It customizes studio-quality sound to your unique ear canal structure, resulting in an unparalleled audio experience.Despite minor room for improvement in bass, I'm smitten with my Realme Air 5 Pro and highly recommend them to anyone seeking exceptional sound quality, comfort, and features.

3,"I've used the T300 headphones for over four months, and they are comfortable with good active noise cancellation, offering 30db of reduction. In contrast, the T310 headphones feel uncomfortable after more than an hour, leading to headaches, making them unsuitable for long-term use. While the T310‚Äôs noise cancellation works well for calls, it only cancels out air and fan noise, not traffic noise. The T300, with its better noise cancellation, is the superior option.Now I feel stuked with T310 because I can't return it üò≠üò≠ I have to live with it",T300 is better than T310,2

The realistic battery life is 4 hrs of buds alone and like 50 hrs on case. The sound quality is mediocre.

4,Pros:- Extremely comfortable with decent fit: I almost forget that i have it on at times- Very smooth connectivity across 2 devices at a time- Battery is solid. I have had it on for 7-8 hrs during travel at about 60% volume and switching between noise cancellation and transparency mode. I don't foresee me using it beyond this duration in one goCons:- The noise cancellation is inconsistent. It sometime shuts off automatically and turns on even when it's set to manual mode... this is momentary but still annoying- I played around a lot with the equalizer of Hey melody app but I'm not able to get a sound which I love even after . It's pretty decent honestly but what I'm missing is a wider soundstage and clarity of instruments in songs. The golden sound helped a bit but on the whole I'm slightly underwhelmedSolid pair of earbuds on the whole for daily use.,Good in many aspects,2

4,"Tl;DR version: Pros: good sound, durability and size. Cons: bad seal with default eartips so low bass.For whatever reason, none of the ear-tips included in the box resulted in a good seal. This resulted in a severe lack of bass. Once I got a set of large foam eartips to solve that problem, these are the best sounding TWS to me so far, compared with things like buds pro 1, buds2, buds+, airpods pro (2nd and 1st gen), oneplus buds pro and so on.That said, the best thing about these IMO, is the edge-tap feature that can be enabled in the experimental mode. This way, I can tap my right ear twice to increase volume, and left ear to reduce it. I miss this feature the most when listening to other earphones/headphones.",5 stars with different ear-tips for better seal.,2
4,"Everything is good in this earbuds, noise cancellation, transparency mode and highlight point is that calling quality is best in this earbuds, negative point is that I have iPhone device, but Samsung removed Galaxy wearable app in app store So I can't customize my earbuds with my Apple Device For this I have to use my other Android device This is very annoying otherwise this Samsung Galaxy Buds 2Pro is the best earbuds",Not perfect but according to price worth it product,2
4,"This is not just a problem with Realme alone, but I guess almost 99% of TWS and neckbands out there. The outofthebox control scheme of these products are abysmal and even though the app allows reconfiguration of the controls, it's barely any good. There's so many arbitrary restrictions of what and what not can be assigned to a guesture that it completely ruins the whole product experience.Before making a purchase decision, I would suggest first checking out YouTube videos , not the reviews of flashy channels with eye candy thumbnails, but rather the boring long term usage ones.",Amazing hardware held back by infuriating software,2

Have to disconnect Bluetooth manually in phone! Need to fix that issue,Good product!,2
4,"This is my first tws. Prior to this i had neckband. In this segment and price range i had really great expectations and most of them are met in this product. As i experience sound quality, ANC, voice call are all great but i am little reserved to talk about asthetics of these earbuds because i think sticks are little thicker. Before the purchase i didn't give it a thought because it didn't occur to me. Now i look up on oppo enco air 3 as well and i think they would look better. I can compromise on battery but looks are important because i am little conscious how people perceive me so i will try to return.",Sticks are little thicker,2

The other person can literally hear everything in your environment so clearly but also they can hear your voice properly. It doesn't cut out environment noise. I used them with iphone and the calls were just great with noise isolation feature on iphone. But on samsung they offer voice focus feature only for phone's microphone.

5,"Impressive Sound and Comfort at a Great Price!I've been using the Noise N1 Pro headphones for a few weeks now, and they‚Äôve exceeded my expectations, especially given the price range. Here‚Äôs my takeSound Quality: The audio is clear with a solid balance between bass, mids, and highs. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the overall sound signature is enjoyable for various music genres. The noise isolation is decent, though not at the level of premium noise-cancelling models, but it works well in quieter environments.Comfort & Fit: The lightweight design makes them really comfortable for extended listening sessions. The ear cups are soft and cover my ears completely without causing discomfort. Even after long hours of use, they don't feel heavy or cause ear fatigue, which is a big plus.Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I‚Äôve been able to get around 60 hours of playback on a single charge, which is perfect for long trips or just forgetting to charge them frequently.Design & Build: They look sleek with a minimalistic design. The build quality is solid, though mostly made of plastic, but it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. The foldable design is a nice touch for portability.Connectivity: Pairing with my devices was seamless, and the Bluetooth connection is stable, even when I move around. No noticeable lag during calls or watching videos.",Nice product,2

5,"Design & Comfort:The earbuds have a sleek, minimalist design and fit comfortably in the ears.They come with silicone ear tips in different sizes, ensuring a snug and secure fit for most users.Sound Quality:The Buds N1 provide a balanced sound profile with decent bass. While not as punchy as higher-end models, the bass is satisfactory for casual listening.The mids and highs are clear, making them a good choice for listening to music and podcasts.These earbuds are not for audiophiles but perform well for their price.Battery Life:They boast a decent battery life of up to 10 hours on a single charge, with the case providing an additional 24 hours.Fast charging support is a bonus, allowing you to quickly top up the battery in case of emergencies.Bluetooth 5.2:With Bluetooth 5.2, the connection is stable, and pairing with devices is quick and seamless.The range is also decent, allowing you to move around without experiencing drops in connection.Touch Controls:The touch controls are responsive and easy to use.

The touch sensors are responsive, making it easy to control your music and calls without fumbling with your phone.The design is another standout feature‚Äîit's unique and eye-catching, setting it apart from other earbuds on the market. However, there are a couple of downsides. Firstly, the lack of active noise cancellation is noticeable, especially in noisy environments. Secondly, it doesn‚Äôt come with a protective cover, which could be a concern for portability and security.In summary, if you prioritize sound quality and design, the UFO Boult AirPods are a great choice, but be aware of the missing noise cancellation and protective features.","Great Sound with Unique Design, but Lacks Key Features",2

4,"Review after 10 day usage:1. Comfort: I used them extensively for 3-4 hours. It does hurt a little after long usage. The fit was perfect. The silicon Buds are soft and custom made for these earphones so you can't put just any buds on it.2. Weight: They are very light. Impressive weight management done by company.3. Functionality: They connect within 5 seconds of opening the case. The sound quality is decent. I would rate it 4/5 because I have heard better but it does ok in this price range. The highs are good, mids are okayish and the lows are clear. Bass is good. Link the realme app for handling the equalizer better. The touch controls are ok ok. Could have been better responsive. Also would be better if volume could be controlled by touch.4. ANC & Calls: I tried calls at a bus stand and it does a decent job. Since it has 2 microphones for ANC, I wasn't expecting complete noise cancellation and it doesn't do that too. However, call quality is impressive to the person at the other end. Voice is clear if you're in a semi-busy environment too. With loud music playing in the gym, the ANC really helps when you want to listen to your own.5. Battery life: Have to test that yet, however the battery is decent with 60% volume.6. Build quality: The case feels premium, do use a silicon case for the earbuds case. The tws earphones are also of good quality.Overall: 4/5. Go for it if you're looking for a good tws earphones under 2k. Got it for 1700.",Decent TWS earbuds in this price range.,3

4,Way better than oppo enco air 3 pro. Sound is way better at this price point with 3D audio features for watching movies and OTT is fun.ANC is very good way better then many premium earbuds.Sound volume is also very high but adjustable with the realme link app.Connectivity is very consistent.One important thing being as per me buy beige  colour over black one to enjoy good bass . I tried both the colour options but returned black as sound is more hallow then the beige colour. Don't know the reason but both sound different.I am happy with the product .,Most interesting Earbuds at affordable price,3

A standout feature is the ""Combat Mode"" for gaming, which reduces latency, giving you a competitive edge. The battery life is solid, and the compact case is convenient for travel.Initially, the earbuds connected quickly, but over time, the connection has slowed down, which is frustrating, especially when you‚Äôre in a hurry. It would be great if Boult could address this issue to restore the quick connection speed it had when new.",Good product experience.,3
4,"Everything is good but there is something I wanna add specifically. The sibilance..Around 12k to 13.5k the highs, it's very shrill. Even non sibilance words sounds very sharp.Issue is the given Equalizer in Wearable app is bad, and you can use Other Eqs such as Wavelet but they only provide certain bands..I used SoundID paramareic eq to cut those specific frequencys around 3db. It's so much better now..So if you are an Audiophile or a Mix engineer, keep that in mindUpdate, after 2 months.Ig my ears are now adapted to it. It's awesome!!It's too good tbh. Many people say 3d and head tracking is gimmik. No it's not, it's the best thing I have heard and I always use it. It send me to a different dimension. You can hear everything clearly from where it's coming in the mix.I can visualize the stereo field so accurately with 3d audio. It's perfect.The box is not that durable, the matte finish is peeling off already in 2 months :(.",Sibilance,3
4,Got it For around 899 bucks..Pros:Sound quality is decent. I have Dolby Atmos and Hi-Fi audio. The base was way too over powering in Hi-Fi and after switching to Dolby and playing with equalizer it came to my liking.Quad Mic works. I had few calls with indoor and outdoor conditions the recipient was able to hear me adequately. These doesn't have ANC and other feature but still the quad mic impressed me.Passive noise cancelling is there and you can feel it.Cons:The look. I went for blue thinking it has a darker shade inside but no hated it once I opened. It was so bright that i regretted the decision for the color.The magnets of the buds are not strong one shake and bud comes loose from the case.Build quality is okay not exceptional.No comment on battery backup yet as I have not used them for that long. Don't play games on phone so will not comment on that.This is still initial review will post more in future if I have the motivation üôÉ,Initial review - Seems like a steal,3

4,"The product sounds good, mild, with highs, lows and instrument seperation accurately. When compared with realme its volume and noise cancelling is lil low. And in apple music i could get quality only upto Dolby atmos, it doesn‚Äôt play in  lossless/ hi-res lossless, may be because it only has upto AAC. Overall its good but not realme may sound a lil more bassy, more volume and more ANC.",Oneplus vs Realme,3
4,"Using galaxy buds 2 pro for more than 1 weekPros  built is good (rubber typ) , features are goodSound quality is (sharp)decent you may like it or may not they also dont have any customisable EqualizerIf your budget is under 10k and want a small rounded design buds would be a great choiceTip : buy under offer or during sale as of now they are under 8.5k",Is this worth it?,3
4,"They're great. I was using Buds Z2 before. Personally I feel they stayed put in my ear, and fit better than this. I did try changing the buds, it didn't help. Quite risky. But I can overlook this given that battery, audio/sound, mic are all better with this one. Love the ability to increase/decrease the volume. The buttons are a little hard to locate, since in Z2 they had a physical boundary, these don't have that.",A few cons,3

The pTron Zenbuds EVO X2 TWS earphones are a perfect blend of style and performance. Their sleek design is eye-catching, while the sound quality is exceptional with deep bass, crisp highs, and immersive clarity.*I would like to highlight some points*# The led lights on the charging case is the best part because it provide a premium experience and a ambient light like looks.# Also the 13mm driver provide a deep punchy bass and crisp vocal.# If you use the tws at 30-50% volume you will get near about 10-11 hours of music playback time on a single charge.# It comes with a premium matte finishing.# Fits of the earbuds are really good and perfect for all types of ear.Highly recommended!","Sound quality, Feel, Material",3

5,"The OnePlus Buds 3 impress with their exceptional noise cancellation, which effectively blocks out ambient sounds, making them perfect for both busy environments and quiet moments. Switching between noise cancellation modes is incredibly easy, allowing users to save battery life effortlessly.A standout feature is the customizable equalizer, which adjusts audio settings based on your hearing capabilities, delivering a personalized listening experience. The controls for navigating tracks and adjusting volume are intuitive and responsive, enhancing usability.However, the chrome metal finish, while stylish, does attract fingerprints, which can be a bit bothersome.

5,"2-3 yrs back , I used to hate Realme audio products because of their lack of sound clarity, instrument separation. I could only notice very heavy & bloated mid range base without much clarity in mids & high's. Things are upside down now.I'm also using Realme Air 5 Pro, oppo Air3 pro, soundcore Liberty Air 2 & Soundcore Liberty 4 (MRP 18k).I'm really amazed with Air 6 Pro tunning this time, it is more refined in its base & high's now.Realme has done amazing job in its audio products over past years. Kudos to them.Oppo Air 3 pro has more clear mids, buds lags in call quality.Comparing with 18k soundcore Liberty 4, Air 6 Pro has more punchy base but mids, high's, sound staging in Liberty 4 is superior (but offcourse after discount it costs more than double).But overall Air 6 Pro is an amazing package in this price range,  great job done Realme.Also using Realme wireless 3 neckband & it is also far more superior in music clarity & have well tuned drivers than OnePlus wireless z2 anc neckband (which falls flat in sound staging & instrument separation)","Amazing sound quality, more accurately tuned then previous Air 5 Pro",3
5,"The buds are great the sound is good so is the comfort and ANC, but i am worried because the seller sent me made in india ones and i think amzon sells made in india ones in substitute to made in vietnam ones. So far i cannot see any difference in quality or any other thing hoping for the best",very good true wireless buds,3

5,"This is my first premium ear buds and I got this mini beast around 6.5k during Amazon great Indian festival sale and it is definitely worth buying at this price. The size is so compact that I can easily carry in my pocket. It has got great features and sound quality is also pretty good. In this price you will get wireless charging, you can charge it from your mobile if your mobile has reverse wireless charging option.Although I'm a bass lover and bass on these ear buds is quite good but not great but you can customise the equalizer on your phone's setting and get good amount of bass.This ear buds has a well balanced sound and it will enhance your experience of watching movies, especially movies with Dolby audio.Battery is also fine, normally it can lasts upto 7-8 hours if you use it without ANC for calling and listen music on 60% volume.

5,"I clearly state that this is one of it's kind earbuds, from unboxing till it goes in your ear canal the experience is premium and the biggest convience is the software support, google fast pair  connect with Androids and windows too quickly the you won't even know when it turned itself on, call quality is great mic does pick up some back noises but it clear's out most of the noise , i also fell in love with (jade nova) colour option , I got it for @2500\- its great for that price. I even have a JBL wave beem which retails around @3500\- and these on sale cost around @2500\- for that price JBL is a heads down",Is this buds even real!!??,3
1,"Environment Noise cancellation doesn't work, seems like it's only a marketing strategy. The call pick up function doesn't work. Only thing good could be the battery back up which I've not tested and I'm returning the product. It turns off in 10 seconds automatically if not connected. Sound quality is average.",Fraudulent product,4
3,- With every 10 percent drop of the battery level the device gets automatically disconnected.- Though its sound quality is satisfactory with enough bass the microphone is of poor quality.- After connecting if one doesn't use the device immediately it disconnects and turns off automatically.- It often doesn't respond to touch and has been difficult to use since the beginning.- The charging pod is glitchy and sometimes the device doesn't get charged at all.,Has a mind of its own!,4

4,"Noise Cancellation is good for work environment, not sure about very noisy environment but it helps me at work to focus on the person on the other end when on a callTransparency mode is 3.5/5, some AI would have been great to recognise human voice who is near you so that it can amplify human voice I'm your ear so that you can hear the person speaking to you without taking out the earpiece, else it good for the price.The dual drivers does their job well, the sound is great, I have zero qualms on the sound side, although dynamic range could have been better, I give sound and enjoyability of music a solid 4.5/5 but 3.5/5 to dynamic rangeIt can connect to two devices simultaneously and it is a boon for me, it's connected to my S23 Ultra, my laptop and my watch is connected to my phone, so I can easily switch between devicesBluetooth connectivity is blazing fast, kudos for that.The comfort of earbuds could be better but see, it is subjective and really depends on the ear shape and size, my ears are medium size, the default buds on the earpiece fits best in my ears and doesn't fall even if I jump or do some activity but I can't wear it continuously for more that 2 hours, which is good for me, I don't wear them more than two hours, and anyway in ear earbuds never feel natural, so that's something one has to adjust with, it could be any brand, not specific the OnePlus Buds 3Charging is fast and good 6-8 hours in one full charge of the earbuds, with Case, I use it for more than 7 days easilyCase weight is light, it doesn't feel heavy, although the finish is matte and the case can easily slip if you have dry hands like me, I would suggest to get a cheap silicone cover for itIf you can get it for 4k or 4.5k, go for it..",Worth it for the price,4

Depends on usage also.Dual pairing: We can connect 2 devices at a time. So we can move from 1 device to another.Bluetooth version: It's updated version 5.4 . So there is no connectivity issue.ANC: Upto 46 db this is also good move.Mics: Total 6 are there, so it'll give more clarity while on calls.Sound: This is next level. Bass lovers must buy this and experience it.Noise cancellation: There are 3 different levels, so we can choose which one we want as per our situation.Sound effects: There are bass, vocal etc. Even we can customise the Equalizer of sound.Cons:They're not providing charging cable.If they can give features like volume control through earbuds and in ear detection then experience is next level.",Worth Product,4
5,"First of all, these earbuds are so comfortable. I feel no fatigue even after wearing for an hour which I feel in others. Noise cancellation works good and dedicated wind noise reduction helps albeit with impact on anc which is true for all buds.Sound quality is balanced, case is sturdy, connection is quick, calling is clear with good noise reduction.Single tap is not there and it is very good. In all earphones accidental touch leads to pausing the content. Realme has put lot of thought in this product.Only problem I faced is in app case battery is shown always full.Overall good value for money. It has LDAC which is supported by all phones. Samsung phones don't support LHDC and anyone with them should only purchase LDAC supported earbuds if you care about sound quality.Battery life is good and on par with competition.",Near perfect earbuds for price..,4
1,"Total waste of money, what I expected from JBL brand is not there in this product. Even if you put the mobile on full volume, you can hear two people standing nearby talking. There is no volume at all. I have tried iPhone and Samsung mobile also but the voice quality is rubbish. It is better to buy some other brand instead of spending 5000 rupees on this. Moreover, there is no return option also. JBL tune 245NC model total waste of money don't buy",Total west of money,5
1,"""I recently purchased the JBL 245NC earbuds,primarily for their advertised ANC feature and expected crisp call quality.

3,"In a silent place, like in office, it is really good.But the noise cancellation is not effective if you are in traffic (sitting in an autorickshaw). People on the other side still complained.Fits well... to your ears...very light, you wont feel the heaviness, download HeyMelody to configure the ear plugsSometimes, the blue tooth connectivity gets disconnected.Kind of OK product.

4,"The earbuds are really good and high quality, the in hand feel and ear feel is great but for the price I feel like more features could have been given such as better noise isolation... For me the right earbud appears to be lose, falling out easier than the left, tried changing eartips but it was the same, maybe my right ear canal is wider but felt important to mention. The clarity is great, the charging is fast and the earbuds last a really long time, I have been using them for a couple weeks now and even after using them for couple house straight 3-4+ they still remaind above 40% with ANC off. With ANC on it was 20% after 4 hours. Over all really good earbuds but some extra features at this price such as better fitting and noise isolation would make them great.",Good but not enough to justify the price,5
4,"Model name :- Ptron zenbuds X1I have been using these buds for 2 and a half months. Here is my honest review.1) Sound quality (8/10) - Good sound quality. Clear vocals. But highs and lows keep changing in a song. May feel high and low in sound while listening to a song. Sometimes a weird creaking sound comes while listening for a long time. I don't know why.2) Bass (7/10) - Average bass. Not too deep bass. But a satisfactory bass. It is good. Bass lovers may be disappointed but is good for this price range.3) Design ( 9/10) - Nice design. But case lid is average. Lid is not too tight. But, buds won't fall. Magnets in it are good.4) comfort (9/10) - Very good comfort. Using proper earcups (rubber) will keep tight fitting in year. Can use for more than 2 hours.5) Modes (10/10) - There are different modes available for different purposes. There are 3 modes available :- Game mode, Movie mode and Music mode. Although all sound the same, there is a little bit difference felt when changing the mode and listening6) Functionality :- 13mm drivers, BT 5.3 connectivity, In ear sensors ( Plug in ear to song play, remove the earbuds from ears and music will pause, plug in again and it will play), IPX5 water resistant, Low latency gaming, Four Quad mics ENC calls, Type C charging (Note :- use only a 10 W charger and not more than that. Never use 25W , 33W , 50W, 65W, 100W etc) .7) Battery - The box says 40 hours play time. Not sure correct or not. But it does come around 40 hours only. Again use a 10w charger and not more than that. Charging or battery indicator is also given. When the case light is still green color, means charge is there, like when u put buds in case green light turns ON and stays constant means buds are charging. Also buds have light. Once fully charged case light will Off. If case light blinks means case battery is low. When case is put in charge red light will show blinking.( always put buds in case while charging). Once case is fully charged the red light will stay constant. Detach the charger then. Then it will start showing green light. The light turns off on its own after a few minutes so don't worry.Overall a good product and features are good according to the price. I bought it for 799rs",Ptron zenbuds X1,5
4,"1) Sound is really exceptional for a 12.4mm driver. Audio for my buds felt shifted a bit towards right. Adjustable in phone settings: Go to Accessibility --> Hearing --> Channel Volume Balancing. If this setting is not available on your device, replace your buds, contact Realme Support.2) Bass is not that punchy but adjustable in their app.3) Treble felt a bit peaked making the sound sharp for ears but simultaneously clear with the seperation. Unfortunately there is no option to adjust it unless you how to adjust custom equalizer.4) Spatial Audio is good, don't expect it to as good as bose, Sennheiser or Apple but for entry level, acceptable.5) Dolby Atmos works only if your mobile supports it. Check in your audio settings before purchasing. In my device it works (Realme X7 Max)6) Charging is durable as mentioned in the description.7) Design feels comfortable but the ear tips size should have been a bit bigger (depends on your ear canal, mine is wider than usual).8) Case hinges are great and tight.9) Colour depends on what you select and finish is mat and scratches aren't visible if any. LED works as intended.10) Charging port should have had a cover. For longer run, dust will surely accommodate in it. Make sure to clean it regularly.",Overall Review,5
5,"One Plus Buds 3 is a very good buy for me.Its sound is very good.Noise Cancelation works wonderfully.Can be connected to 2 devices at a time.Quick connect works wonderfully. As soon as we open the case, bluetooth gets connected.If you remove any one buds from ear, the song or movie will stop and as soon as you put it in again in ear, it resumes.The only thing which gave some confusion to me is the case. Its hinge is kind of here & there. Like if you try to check its sides and from mid, it looks like its moving. Not much impact. Just a bit.Otherwise its a good buy with what this price tag",Good Buy with these features,5
5,"The earpiece is comfortable and I am able to wear it for a long time. These buds are light and easy to wear. You are given three different sizes to choose from for the ear pads so you get the best fit. I honestly was blown away by the sound quality of these earbuds. Sound was crisp and base quality was very good. The noise cancellation feature is amazing which helps me to communicate even in a noisy environment. The earbuds connectivity is great too. As soon you put the ear piece in your ear is connects automatically which I love a lot. There are Type-C charging ports, which is very usefull and unique. The Type-C charging ports ensure compatibility with Android chargers. The battery life is impressive as I can use it for hours without needing to constantly recharge it.

4,"I have been using relame buds air 3 for last 2 years. But i felt it's time to upgrade,  so went at first went with galaxy buds 2 pro for my s23. Frankly they are worse in fit,battery,ANC(during bike/cycling),touch controls. So returned it and went with realme buds 6 pro.My observation (not an audiophile)1. Sound : they are for sure on par or better than buds 2 pro and realme air 3. Has clear and good vocals, great Bass and treble.2. Touch controls :could have been better with support for volume controls using sliding touch.3. Features: surround sound(360¬∞ audio) is good.  There is no support of spatial audio. Coming to other features like in ear recognition for pause and play is awesome. ANC works well, transparency mode could be improved.  It would be better if they had voice detect feature like galaxy buds 2 pro.4. Battery : best in class.5. Build : very good except eartips. They same eartips as realme air 3. I have only one problem with these eartips. They are very thin which causes them to disform while inserting and removing. It is not at all expected. They should have used good material for the price of 5k.",Mixed review,6
4,"First and foremost I'd get out the issues:1. The ANC works well 90% of the time, but sometimes when I travel by road, I still keep hearing the vehicle horns or when I go by metro, I can still hear loud voices, even in full ANC mode.2. The Biggest issues is the brief pause that happens when I switch between apps on my phone. For example, if I'm listening to music from my music app thru these headphones and I go to a game app, it pauses the sound for a second and then plays again. This happens even when I come back to home screen.3. The bass is quite good but does not work as well in noisy environments even when ANC is on. So, I keep increasing the bass manually and the music loses quality.Those were the main issues I've faced, but by now my ears have been habituated to them, so they aren't that troubling for me anymore (that's why 4 stars). These are good ones for budget wireless earbuds and especially if you own a OnePlus phone.",Works quite well... but has some notable issues,6
5,"This product is gr8 for callings required for office calls. Listening music and for other purposes as well. Also, it is compatible for iphones and to make the best of use earbuds hey melody app is required. It has ANC and advanced features.

4,"Considering the price point and the hardware provided it is still one of the best alternative to Oppo enco earbuds ( Including Oppo enco X2) if you tune it properly.Probably might have been the best product if realme had tuned it properly out of the box. With the hardware provided realme is definitely not sincere to this buds in tuning the earbuds to the fullest of its potential.Out of the box it is bass heave any sounds muddy in the mids, and highs are also not so clear.Once you tweak it as per your required sound signature using the equilizer you can achieve one of the best possible output from these buds. Even better than those which costs more than double than these.Pros :1. Good built quality.2. Pairs with both Android and IOS devices without issue.3. Dual device pairing4. Awesome ANC for the price range.5. Superb battery life with fast charging.6. Great call quality.7. Realme link app support for customization.8. Almost nil false touches.9.

And after my experiences with all these products, I bought the Nord Buds 2r at 1500 rs. And I am truly amazed. At under 2000 I don't think there is a more balanced TWS in the market. Most TWS at this range focuses on being bass heavy, and this too has a boomy bass unlike the ones in the Oppo, Boat or Boult ones in this range. The sound signature can be tuned in the app. The Oppo buds above 3000 is perhaps much better but at this range Oneplus is the king. I feel using the default sound profile, the sound doesn't hurt your ears in long hours of usage. The drivers are good. The ENC is fair enough for the price. You can take calls. Not the best experience but a very decent one. Overall, I would rate this as one of the best under 2000 and if you get it at 1500, it is a steal deal.",Bang for the buck !!,7
5,"I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds duo, and I have to say, they have exceeded my expectations. As someone who is conscious of their budget, I was initially unsure about how they would perform, but after testing them out, I have been pleasantly surprised by what they offer for their price.Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is their impressive audio quality. The bass response is strong and impactful, as the name suggests. For those who enjoy bass-heavy music, these earbuds will not disappoint. However, the bass does not overwhelm and maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound profile leans towards warmth, making them ideal for genres such as pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.Design and Comfort: The design of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is sleek and compact, with a glossy finish that gives them a premium look. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears and come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a personalized fit for long-term use. I appreciate the touch controls, which are easy to use for managing playback and calls without needing to reach for my device.Battery Life: The battery life of the Ptron Bassbuds duo is impressive. With a full charge, I was able to get approximately 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case provided an additional 27 hours, which is more than sufficient for my daily usage. The inclusion of a USB Type-C charging port allows for quick and convenient charging.Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds duo with my smartphone was simple, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal interruptions during use.Call Quality: While the sound quality for music playback is excellent, the call quality on the Ptron Bassbuds duo is average. Callers mentioned that my voice sounded slightly muffled, and the built-in microphone did not provide the best noise isolation in noisy environments.Final Thoughts: The Ptron Bassbuds duo offer great value for money, delivering an impressive audio experience at an affordable price. They excel in bass reproduction, making them a great option for bass enthusiasts. The design, comfort, and battery life are all noteworthy, and the addition of touch controls is a positive feature. Although the call quality could be improved, it is not a significant issue considering the overall package.If you are looking for wireless earbuds that provide excellent sound performance and functionality without breaking the bank, the Ptron Bassbuds duo are a fantastic choices",Quality product,7
5,"OnePlus buds 3 are exceptional piece of earbuds you can buy right now in the market, These lovely buds will be praised for its performance, I'm myself a audio engineer and audiophile, i can approve these buds have definitely set the benchmark for true meaning of value for money, from sub bass to crispy airy high frequency these are phenomenal because you have control over each section of frequency band and further tweak those frequency as per your liking, These buds bangs the sub bass in 15 to 40hz and highs also sounds smooth they do not create fatigue, Hey melody app is great but i also use XEQ app for more tweaks, I'm definitely in love with these, Cheers to OnePlus for raising the bar so high that companies understand the value for money of there products.Edit :- Applying Golden Sound is very important because it will recognise your ear canal fit and further adjust the frequency of each band as per your hearing, cheers‚ù§Ô∏èüôè",Ethereal Music Experience,7

4,"I purchased the Realme 6 Pro after watching numerous comparison reviews on YouTube.The earpods' quality, sound clarity, and active noise cancellation (ANC) are impressive. The ANC features, such as smart de-wind technology, offer personalized noise cancellation. However, l've noticed that while ANC is excellent for music, it's better to turn it off during calls to ensure the other person can hear my voice clearly (around 70% clarity). With ANC enabled, my voice sounds robotic and unclear.As an former Apple AirPods Pro user, I was disappointed with their short lifespan (only lasting a year). In comparison, the Realme 6 Pro offers better value for its price and features, especially for music. However, if call clarity is a priority, I recommend using a good wired headset instead of earpods. Wired headsets provide superior call clarity since the mic is closer to your mouth. ANC can sometimes compromise voice clarity by canceling out surrounding sounds.",Nice one though. Good sound quality and anc.,12

4,"Impressive Sound and Comfort at a Great Price!I've been using the Noise N1 Pro headphones for a few weeks now, and they‚Äôve exceeded my expectations, especially given the price range. Here‚Äôs my takeSound Quality: The audio is clear with a solid balance between bass, mids, and highs. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and the overall sound signature is enjoyable for various music genres. The noise isolation is decent, though not at the level of premium noise-cancelling models, but it works well in quieter environments.Comfort & Fit: The lightweight design makes them really comfortable for extended listening sessions. The ear cups are soft and cover my ears completely without causing discomfort. Even after long hours of use, they don't feel heavy or cause ear fatigue, which is a big plus.Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. I‚Äôve been able to get around 60 hours of playback on a single charge, which is perfect for long trips or just forgetting to charge them frequently.Design & Build: They look sleek with a minimalistic design. The build quality is solid, though mostly made of plastic, but it doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. The foldable design is a nice touch for portability.Connectivity: Pairing with my devices was seamless, and the Bluetooth connection is stable, even when I move around.

5,"I love this ear buds. Using it since a year. Bought in last year's sale for 7.2k. I paid 500 rs extra for the Bora purple colour otherwise could have got it around 6.5k. with bank offers some bought it for 6k also. Coming to the performance it's great. I use it daily. I am an avid music listener & anime watcher. So I use it daily. Battery lasts upto one week for 1 day charging. I usually charge it on Sunday night and use it throughout the week. I only use it during the daytime and during my commute approx 8-9 hrs/day. The sound quality is top notch. I don't have a samsung mobile. Still the sound quality is good. With samsung mobile it's even better. Coming to the fit it is very comfortable. I use it on public transport also. It never get loose from my ear or fall off. But still I use it with care in public. Also it is not uncomfortable to wear for long time but if I use ANC with both the ear plugged for longer time then it's a bit uncomfortable. I normally put only one bud, that way it is more comfortable to wear I feel. All in all its a great bud. For long time use and good battery backup and with good sound it is the best in the market I think. So 5 stars from me. Although recently sometimes it gets disconnected but then again gets reconnected shortly and the purple colour tend to get dirty with time. Otherwise it's a great purchase. I will recommend people to buy it.","Fit, sound quality, battery backup",13

Pairing them was quick and effortless, and the touch controls make it super easy to manage playback, calls, and volume without reaching for my phone.Clarity:The sound quality is crystal clear.

4,"I have been struggling with the wired earphones a lot lately. I always used to think that wired earphones are much better when it comes to the sound quality and the latency. And, the statement still stands true. However, what I didn't knew was that the bluetooth earphones also shines in their own department.The wired ones although provide you great sound quality and minimum latency but keeping  them without tangling them is a hassle in its own. They tangle too fast and in an unsightly manner as well. Bluetooth ones completely removed this problem.This realme earset comes with a sleek beautiful black cover case paired with light cream colour in the inside. A great combination of colours. The package offers you a short lead cable for fast charging. I just connect the cable to my phone's charger and it easily charges it to full within a few hours. Even, if you charge it for a few minutes, the battery will easily last for some hours. It has a good battery backup.The sound quality is good too. It's loud and clear. They fit very well in your ears. And, there are several 'touch response' functions as well.Double tap any earpiece and whatever you're listening will pause. Double tap again to resume it. Holding an earpiece will activate its noise cancellation mode. And, holding it again will switch it to the normal mode.And, I must say that the noise cancellation is pretty good. Being a student, I use it in library to concentrate on my study and it easily repels all the noises from your surroundings. If the sound is too loud then it will face some difficulties. For example : If you're sitting right next to a cooler then, you'll be able to hear a little sound. But, it's still a lot better than hearing it in actual.It's portable too. You can easily carry it within your pocket. Now, the two problems I faced in it were the 1) Usage while on calls and, 2) Latency. I was on a road sauntering for a walk when my friend called me. I had my realme earpiece. I picked up his call and answered and he couldn't clearly hear my voice. He asked me, whether I was eating anything. I had to immediately switch it off. The other problem is its latency. These are not meant for gaming at all. If you're a gamer then you must absolutely stay away from these. You'll fire a bullet and it would take some time for you to hear its sound. Because, the latency is high in this one. I didn't mean that it's obviously noticable. But, you'll feel the difference during your gameplay. You'll be able to tell that the responses are coming a little slower than your actions.These are the only problems with this earpiece. It's not made for the calls. And, certainly not for the gaming either. You can talk to people if you're in a closed room but if you're outside then that's a straight NO!Overall, they are really good. I bought them in the diwali sale around 2k or something. So, I'll advice you to either wait for the sale or just go with other options if you want. I have already mentioned the issues it has. If you don't talk with earpiece attached then you can totally buy this. I'm leaving 4 stars just because of the above listed problems.",A powerful product!!! ‚ú®,16
4,"I purchased these earbuds principally for calls on phone and for virtual meetings on PC.  I have used these buds for about 10 days fairly intensively, and I can say that they meet my requirement for calls very well.Call quality at both ends is very good.  The ANC works well to block background noise to an extent. The microphones also block out background noise to a good extent ensuring that calls can be taken in noisy environments without much interference.  I was previously using a ""professional grade"" Bluetooth headphone from Jabra and I can say that the call quality is definitely comparable.The buds have Bluetooth multipoint connectivity which means that the buds connect simultaneously to both my phone and PC.  The buds automatically connect to whichever device (PC or phone) which is transmitting audio.However, to switch devices, we need to manually pause audio on one device and start audio on the other.  There is no other way to force the buds to switch from one audio source to the other.  This gets tricky if you are constantly moving between phone and PC - there are times when the buds don't switch over because some app or the other which is transmitting audio (say a browser page with a video which is playing). Having an express gesture for switching audio streams would have been very useful.Also there is a slight lag when switching from one device to another - dont expect to immediately stop a voice call on phone and immediately switch to a meeting on the PC. You will have a 2-3 second lag for the handover.There is also no gesture for ""mute"" on the headphones. You will need to pull out your device to mute / unmute. Can get a bit annoying if you are taking a call while walking.These issues are however minor.  The call quality and convenience of the buds is really outstanding. Heartily recommend to anyone who is looking for good TWS buds for use at work.---Update after more than a month of usage.The buds tend to work themselves loose after half hour or so and need to be adjusted. Can be a bit annoying if the buds come loose when your hands aren't free, such as when you are cooking.  Of course the fit may vary from person-to-person.The case is also somewhat flimsy.  With just about a month of usage the case has collected nicks and scratches from minor day-to-day wear and tear.  Might be a good idea to get a cover for the case.",Great for calls on phone and PC,18
4,"The OnePlus Nord Buds 2r offer excellent sound quality for the price, making them a solid choice for budget-conscious users. The audio is crisp, with decent bass and clarity for most genres of music. The fit is comfortable, even during extended use, and the battery life is impressive, easily lasting through long listening sessions.However, they lack active noise cancellation, which can be a drawback in noisy environments. The touch controls can also feel a bit unresponsive at times. Despite these minor issues, they are an excellent value for everyday use.","Great Sound and Value, Minor Trade-offs. After one montth",20

I purchased the JBL Tune 245NC TWS earbuds and received them on August 13th. Initially, they worked smoothly as the buds were charged out of the box. However, after using them for a few days, I noticed that the right earbud stopped charging. Despite multiple attempts, it simply wouldn't charge anymore.Amazon promised a 7-day replacement guarantee at the time of purchase. Yet, when I reached out for a replacement on August 18th, I was denied any assistance. This experience has been extremely disappointing and frustrating.Not only am I stuck with a faulty product, but Amazon's refusal to honor their replacement guarantee has left me feeling cheated. I expected better service and support from a company of this stature.I strongly advise against purchasing these earbuds from Amazon. Save yourself the hassle and frustration.

5,"I have been using these for a solid 4 months now and i have used these on a trip in this period too, so i have a pretty good idea about them, lets start with the things- The case itself is pretty sturdy and nice looking but it catches fingerprints so i recommend a cover, as for the hinge its pretty good and the magnets are strong enough for your earbuds to never accidentally fall out.- the battery is absolutely fabulous in my opinion, i have not recorded the time precisely, but it lasts me very long and causes no trouble on ANC and when I turn off the ANC, i just have no complaints.- the ANC itself works very nicely, for this price point it works absolutely fantastic and I couldn‚Äôt ask for something better, i have used these for a long time in trains multiple times and they‚Äôre awesome.- the realme link app works very well on both my android and my iphone, the features on it like different ANC modes, different sound settings, personalised anc, spatial audio, LDAC support, and a lot more and my favourite being the equalizer settings.- the button settings work absolutely well but it could have been better, single tap customisation is not there, its only double tap, triple tap, tap and hold, single tap would have made it perfect as its absence does sometimes feels significant.- the in ear detection is nigh perfect, no complaints there. And the connectivity is amazing too.- and the main factor; the sound, well lets just say despite having a dual driver setup, the earbuds are bass favoured and if you want bass, you couldn‚Äôt go wrong, now dont get me wrong the crispiness and clarity are off the roof too and they can be made way better with the equaliser, trust me on this because I mostly listen to instrumental or vocal focused songs, overall the sound quality is amazing and one can not go wrong with these.",Amazing at the price point,25

To be honest if you wants to unlock the full potential of this Earbuds then u must use apple music app instead of Spotify or YtMusic because it gives the maximum bitrate and sampling rate (24bit&96khz) and it has also the option of Spatial effect in apple music app which is amazing!! [Spotify and YtMusic only supports upto 16kbps and 48khz] Which is not that good]I was using this earphones for 3 days (spotify) and i thought the dual driver (6mm tweeter) is totally nonsense because i didn't noticed anything like a 6mm tweeter for Vocals (treble).But when i switched to Apple Music it blown my mind because of the Hi Res Lossless quality (24bit96khz) thats where i realized that 6mm tweeter is working well !!And there is no need for settings like Dynamic bass or Volume enhancer in the RealmeLink app because AppleMusic's app is like Magic ‚ú®Ô∏è u just dont have to Change your equilizer or anything in the app and i personally use <Rock> in my smartphone's dolby atmos equilizer setting which gives good bass and enough treble üëçüèºSeriously guys when i switched to AppleMusic i got to know about the Real potential of this TWS earphones.AppleMusic app only cost 100Rs per month and its totally worth it!!!!! The Spatial audio effect(3d) in apple music is amazing (for the supported song)  and u can also use the realme buds Spatial audio effect when u watch unsupported movies because it gives u the 3D sound which makes the experience even greater!!I had 2 option to choose from [OppoAir3pro & Realme Air5 pro] and im glad that i choose RealmeAir5Pro because it has Greater battery life and More feature (Obviously oppo's sound quality is +1 but it doesn't matter if it cant gives u more battery life !!!) and to be honest for sound quality realme is already more then enough!!  [BTW im a android user (fold4) but use apple music] U can understand why  ü§° ,,, Use apple music guys !! if not then change (tweak) the equalizer settings according to your Music Taste but still AppleMusic>>>",Why you must use AppleMusic instead of Spotify and YtMusic,32
3,"Before you judge or decide, bear in mind that I am a regular user and no audiophile.My past experience with TWS is with Realme buds air 3 so I will bring lot of reference points from those. The POV keeps price point in mind (JBL 6500 after sale, Realme 3500).JBL Tune Flex review below:Cons:1. Ear detection not available2. Bass: Decent, doesn‚Äôt justify 12mm drivers3. Audio quality is decent. Nothing exceptional. I don‚Äôt know what JBL signature sound is and one of the reason I bought this was to experience that. Honestly I can‚Äôt distinguish much.I am not complaining about the quality, it is good enough. But then realme sounded kind of same at 3500INR.4. ANC is again below average. I have experienced better quality in the Realme.5. Dual connection not supported.Pros:1. JBL app is really good and gives lots of features such as full equaliser control, talk through, gesture configuration, etc.2. You can switch the bud type between Open type or sealed type. But that‚Äôs more like a one time activity and you would probably not swap over to the other side much over the lifetime of these buds.Misc:1. Build quality: Both case and buds have a plastic build. It may or may not be a con for you so take it with a pinch of salt.Verdict: If you have enough money to shell and don‚Äôt give a damn about value for money, go for these. Otherwise, there are better options in the market.",Disappointed ‚ÄºÔ∏è (at the price point they come at),36
4,"I've been using these TWS earbuds for a while now, and I have to say I'm impressed with the overall performance. The noise cancellation works like a charm, especially if you're pairing them with a OnePlus smartphone‚Äîthere's definitely an edge there in terms of seamless integration.**Battery Life:** The battery life is fantastic! It easily lasts me through a full day of use, whether I'm listening to music, taking calls, or just blocking out the noise around me.**Music Quality:** The sound quality is top-notch, especially considering the price point. The bass is deep, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Perfect for music lovers who don't want to break the bank.**Charging:** Charging is reasonably fast, though it's not as quick as I initially expected. Still, it's good enough to give you a decent boost in a short time.**Design & Usability:** These earbuds look awesome and are super easy to use. The design is sleek, and they fit comfortably in my ears. Also easy to carry and fit on ears.**Price Consideration:** Just a heads up‚ÄîI've noticed the price tends to drop after a few weeks, so if you're not in a hurry, you might want to wait for a better deal.Overall, these earbuds are a great buy if you're looking for quality sound, good battery life, and solid noise cancellation at a reasonable price. Highly recommende!",Everything is great.,39
4,"I got it for 6k approx on diwali sale. For that price it's good.This is a feature loaded pair of TWS. Spatial audio, wireless charging noise cancelling and lot more. They all work well. But for me personally they are not worth the hype or the regular 15k price point. I have a song xm400 over the ear headphones. The sound quality of them is unmatched. Even sennheiser wired headphones produce way better sound than this. Not saying this is bad but it's just good. Not the best. The highs and lows, bass and treble instrument separation and other noticeable stuff is there. No qualms in sound department.Personally speaking, I only needed them for convenience sake. TWS small and easy to pocket. Listen wherever. I was thinking of going for oppo enco or realme buds at 5k but since this was available at 6k, took the plunge. For me all the features I mentioned are more of a gimmick than actual features because I don't have a wireless charging pad. And the noise cancelling isn't as powerful as Sony XM400. It's very faint. You can still hear your mother shout at you from the kitchen. Spatial audio needs to be off for me else the listening experience is hampered. Watch and hear movies the way they're intended to.Con is that it doesn't have dual device connection. It can pair with one device at a time. So phone only or laptop only. I requited that feature so that I can work on laptop and phone at the same time with same earbuds. But I found its not there. It can recognize samsung devices and use smart pair. If you have two samsung phones or phone and tablet signed into the same galaxy account,the buds will recognize and pair with both (technically still pairs with one at a time) and if you have a call on your phone it will shift to it.My suggestion, if you have a samsung ecosystem (I do) then go for it. Don't look at the features and think that price is justified. Really think if you are going to use these features or not. If not go for a normal 3-5k tws. They are pretty good and 90% of the stuff these buds do.",Good product,44
4,"--> ANC is 4/10, it puts pressure on your earsdrums and leads to minor headaches on continued hearing. It also barely cancels anything. Like it only stops the sound of a running AC or an overhead Fan but cannot stop the noises of a TV playing in the next room.--> Transparency mode 9.5/10, this is the one thing that I really, really liked about this earphone is that with transparency mode on, you sometimes forget that youre wearing earbuds (except for that random burst of air from the overheard fan which hits the earbud's microphones and causes loud audible wooshing noises.I can comfortably talk to a person infront of me while wearing the headphones, no need to take it off to listen to what they are saying.--> Spacial sound 6/10. With surround sound on, you cannot differentiate between footsteps at 90 and 270 degrees away from you, in laymans terms, If there is an enemy right in front of you and another right behind u, you cant differentiate between their footsteps.--> Sound quality is a solid 7/10, it doesnt give you perfect audio and soundstage but it does its job and thats understandable in its price range. A brief gist of the audio quality would be ""better than 80 rupee earphones but worse than 5000 rupees headphones. You can also use an equalizer to fill in where its default settings lack, but that barely raises the rating to 7.5/10. If you are an audiophile, I wouldn't suggest you to buy this, but if are tight on budget, then go right ahead.--> Build quality 7/10Plastic all around but still feels good in your hands. The case and earbuds are surprisingly quite durable. The earbuds plug in comfortably and stay there without any problems (I am using medium size tips).--> Connectivity: 8/10, It is really good, I can listen to a song clearly with my phone being in my bedroom and me being in the bathroom, which, mind you, is like 10-15 meters away. Only reason why i gave it 8/10 is that when I am listening and I go to scratch my chin or somewhere under the earphone, it somehow blocks the connection and it stops playing for a second and resumes like 0.75-1 second after removing my hand.--> Features: 9/10, getting ANC (however half baked it is) at this price range is really amazing, the bass drivers are also good and ENC during calls is also good.--> Clarity 7/10, clarity is kinda weird, like when I first connected my phone and listened to a song, its vocals sounded like you know, when you play your phone at full volume and put it under a pillow and try listening to it? Yeah it sounded like that BUT the instrumentals were perfectly clear, like crystal clear. I fixed this by using equalizer and then the clarity was good enough.So yeah, overall I would recommend this earphone to every other normal person, but not to audiophiles. At this price range, its features are good, but they couldve been better. So over all 8/10 or 4/5 stars",Good for the price range,77
4,"The market for wireless earbuds has exploded over the years, but finding a pair that hits the right balance between sound quality, design, noise cancellation, and price can be tricky. Enter the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro ‚Äì a product that promises high-end features at an accessible price point. After testing these buds thoroughly, here‚Äôs my in-depth review.1. Design and Build Quality:Right out of the box, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro scream minimalism and sophistication. The black matte finish feels premium, with the sleek design of the buds fitting snugly in the ear. They‚Äôre ergonomically designed, making them comfortable even during extended use. At just 4.9 grams per bud, they‚Äôre lightweight, ensuring no discomfort even after hours of listening.The charging case follows the same minimalist aesthetic, with a compact form factor that easily slips into your pocket. The magnetic closure adds a satisfying snap when you put the earbuds back, and the overall build quality is top-notch for the price.2. Sound Quality:Sound is where the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro truly shine. Equipped with 12.4mm dynamic drivers, the audio performance is surprisingly rich. The bass is deep but well-balanced, never overpowering the mids or highs. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy tracks or acoustic music, the sound remained clear and full-bodied.The clarity across frequencies is impressive, making these earbuds suitable for a variety of genres. The sound profile is natural, with no excessive boosting of any frequency, which is often a downfall in budget earbuds. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys a balanced audio experience with a touch of warmth in the low end, these are perfect.3. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):One of the standout features is the up to 49dB Active Noise Cancellation. This level of ANC is rare to find in earbuds at this price point. Whether you‚Äôre in a noisy coffee shop, commuting, or on a plane, the ANC effectively filters out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.However, the noise cancellation isn‚Äôt the absolute best in the market, but for the price, it works extremely well. It blocks out the majority of low-frequency sounds, though you might still hear some very high-pitched noises. The transparency mode also works well, letting in ambient sound when needed, without making it sound unnatural or muffled.4. Call Quality:Call quality is often a hit or miss with wireless earbuds, but OnePlus has done a commendable job here. During calls, the Nord Buds 3 Pro performed admirably, providing clear and crisp voice quality on both ends. The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) works well, especially in noisy environments, ensuring that your voice cuts through clearly.Whether I was on a busy street or in a quiet room, the other person could hear me without any issues. The four microphones integrated into the earbuds focus on picking up your voice while minimizing background noise, which is impressive for earbuds in this price range.5. Battery Life:Battery life is another strong point. With ANC turned off, you can get up to 44 hours of playback including the charge from the case. Even with ANC enabled, the buds offer around 9 hours on a single charge and about 33 hours total with the charging case, which is more than sufficient for most users.The fast charging feature is a game-changer ‚Äì just 10 minutes of charge gives you up to 11 hours of playback, making them ideal for users who are constantly on the move.6. Connectivity:The Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures a stable and fast connection with almost zero dropouts. Pairing is seamless, especially with OnePlus devices, but even with other Android and iOS devices, the connection is swift and consistent.The low-latency mode is perfect for gamers, offering minimal audio delay, which is crucial during fast-paced gameplay. I experienced no issues with connectivity, even when moving between rooms or keeping my phone in my pocket.7. Additional Features and Functionality:The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro come with IP55 water and dust resistance, which makes them a reliable companion for workouts and outdoor activities. Whether you‚Äôre running in the rain or sweating it out at the gym, these earbuds can handle it without any issues.The touch controls are responsive and allow you to easily manage playback, calls, and ANC modes without needing to take out your phone. You can also customize the touch controls through the HeyMelody app, available on both Android and iOS, giving you more control over your listening experience.8. Pros and Cons:Pros: ‚Ä¢ Balanced Sound Quality with rich bass and clear mids and highs ‚Ä¢ 49dB ANC ‚Äì excellent for this price range ‚Ä¢ Lightweight and comfortable design for long-term use ‚Ä¢ Long battery life with up to 44 hours with the case ‚Ä¢ Fast charging (10 mins for 11 hours of playback) ‚Ä¢ IP55 rating for water and dust resistance ‚Ä¢ Stable connectivity with Bluetooth 5.3 and low-latency gaming modeCons: ‚Ä¢ ANC, while good, may not match the premium models ‚Ä¢ No wireless charging option for the case ‚Ä¢ Touch controls can sometimes be a bit too sensitiveFinal Verdict:The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are a fantastic pair of truly wireless earbuds that offer a near-flagship experience at a mid-range price. From the balanced sound and impressive ANC to the comfortable design and excellent battery life, they deliver on all fronts. The call quality is exceptional, and the fast charging feature is perfect for those always on the go.While there are a few minor drawbacks, such as the lack of wireless charging and ANC that could be improved, these are small compromises considering the price point. Whether you‚Äôre a casual listener, a gamer, or someone who needs a reliable pair of buds for daily use, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are an excellent choice. They‚Äôre packed with features typically found in much pricier models, making them a great value for money.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è#OnePlusNordBuds3Pro #WirelessEarbuds #ANC #FastCharging #BluetoothEarbuds #ClearAudio #TechReview #BestValueEarbuds",A Comprehensive Review: The Sweet Spot Between Performance and Price,87

Noice cancellation it's pretty good as it cut most of the noise like fans, humming or people talking etc but, It can cut heavy sounds like traffic noices. Overall it's AverageüîäFinally let's get to the elephant in the room7.Sound Quality- 6/5 It's has gorgeous 2 way speaker with one woofer for the thumping base & one tweeter for chrisp treble. It also bit 24bit High fidelity audio with the Samsung's seamless codec for crystal clear audio experience. In my experience the base is good but is not the best in class like it's adequate for most people out there. I do really like the treble response as it's really phenomenal and the instrumental separation is also amazing. When it comes to the mids & the lows they also deliver very promising sound experience. It also has 360 spatial audio with headtracking to be frank, I only use it when I consume video content instead of audio üéßFinally verdict If you have a samsung device the it's 100% recommendation to buy it's worth your time & money and if you are a non samsung user then it's not for you because you have other options available in the market and most of the features provided in this buds are limited to galaxy devices. When it comes to the price usually they retail for around 10-13k after a year long and for that price they are phenomenal and you can also get these as low as 7.5k during sales with bank discount and for that price I'm lost of words, It's that's amazing.So that's my review hope you enjoyed and agree with my verdict and if you have any Questions let me know by commenting below & do like if you find it useful",Galaxy Buds 2Pro,197
4,"I had used Enco Air 3 pro before returning them because of bad battery life, quick charge failure and accidental touches. So I'll do a direct comparison for those who are confused between the two options.1. Battery life - It's much better, gives around 4.5 hrs on LDAC + ANC. Quick charge works well. And case life has been quite sufficient but I haven't been able to test it out completely. Oppo barely gave me 3 hours out of case (LDAC+ANC) and quick charge was pathetic. The case charge was also not very good on OPPO.2. ANC - It's slightly better but the difference is noticeable. I'm quite satisfied with it. Oppo's ANC was quite average and did not block out a lot of noises which realme is easily able to.3. Transparency mode - It's well done, with an enhance voice feature and again, slightly better than oppo.4. Sound quality - It's good at the orginal EQ mode but I didn't like the bass modes very much. The sound staging is wide and with the custom EQ option I was able to calibrate them to my liking. Oppo's sound quality was slightly better in my opinion but a custom EQ in realme helps reduce some of that difference.5. Gestures - They are more responsive than Oppo but I see lack of some customizing options. You get a double tap, triple tap and tap+hold but no single tap which could have been useful. It's not a dealbreaker but just a minor nitpick.6. Dual pairing - The pairing was smooth and works well with calls and meetings but media playing is buggy at times and leads to no media playback even if the other device is not playing anything. I'm hoping it gets fixed by a firmware upgrade in the future.7. Calling - The people on the other end told me that realme mic sounded better and performed well under windy and noisy conditions.Comfort - It's comfortable and fits well in my ears but that's subjective to the person using them. It's not very comfortable when you are laying sideways on pillow. The earbuds are slightly heavier than Oppo but it's barely noticeable.I have not extensively tested out the spacial mode and game mode but both work fine as far as I had tested.Another complain would be the realme link app which is sometimes buggy and does not detect the device for in-app operations.In summary, it's a much better option than Oppo Enco Air 3 Pro when it comes to basic features in my opinion. Oppo annoyed the hell out of me because of so many defects and below average features. With realme I feel like I get my money's worth. I've deducted 1 star for the bugs and lack of one-tap gesture option. Everything else is good for the price you pay.",A better alternative to Oppo Enco Air 3 pro,222
5,"It's been 4 days now and I thought of giving a nice feedback. The music experience has been so amazing and wonderful. This is the first time I'm using TWS with ANC enabled. I bought this on Great India Festival sale in 2023 for 7300 rs and it was a steal deal.ANC: It totally restricts external noise but the sharp voice when someone suddenly starts speaking to you can't be restricted and that surpasses the restriction. As this was the first time I was using ANC, I was pretty much amazed how wonderful this tech is. It totally gives the right feel when listening to music and I don't think that I'll ever want non-ANC featured earphones/headphones anymore. After using these buds for 1 month, I can argue that sometimes the ANC feature doesn't work as good as the other times.Touch control: these buds have so many features but I struggle hard when I've enabled double tap for both changing the music and controlling volume. Controlling volume is difficult to perform sometimes. You get an app for controlling them with a widget on your homescreen to turn off ANC and touch control and that widget is extremely helpful and needed app. Pixel buds have swipe gesture to control volume, maybe that feature will increase battery consumption more but it's more convenient than tapping. My worst experience was with volume control on these earbuds and I had to turn that feature off because this doesn't work satisfactorily.Battery: With ANC enabled, I get around 4 hours of backup on buds and my case battery lasts for 2+ days. It doesn't take much time to charge. With ANC disabled I can use buds for 5+ hours.Connectivity: I can use these buds on laptop and all my phones but not at the same time. if these are connected to one device, you'll have to disconnect to pair with other device. But it's not a big issue. You won't struggle with connectivity. Most of my devices are very old and they connect seamlessly.24 bit and 360 degree audio: Not available for all devices, only work on samsung phones with latest ONEUI. These additional feautres are why these are costly. I don't find these features useful at all ‚Äî feel more like gimmicks to me. 360¬∞ audio is terrific, I haven't tested much but I guess you won't find this feature on any other TWS. If you don't require these features, you can go for buds2 if you don't have a budget.Sound quality and bass: Sound and bass both are clear and balanced. You can hear details of every instrument clearly. The quality of sound is amazing and I have personally never had this experience with other earphones before.Size, fitting and appearance: I don't know why some people criticize it for being too bulky, It's not really a big deal and easily fits in the pocket. Buds are great but you can't wear them for long time, they hurt ears if you keep wearing them for 3+ hours.I can rate each feature individually now:ANC: 8/10Sound Quality: 9/10Touch control: 7/10Fit and finish: 8/10Connectivity with different devices: 10/10Battery: 9/10Update after 6 months of use: The product's build quality is good, but Samsung is gradually reducing the sound quality with each update. The Buds2 Pro doesn't have its original audio signature anymore, for which these buds were once famous. The latest update has significantly impacted sound quality and increased treble which is hurting my ears. While there's a way to downgrade to older firmware but it's pointless that Samsung is doing this and it's not worth it considering the price you have to pay for these buds. I hope that Samsung rolls out new update with better audio signature and if it doesn't, then I'd suggest you go for other earbuds.",I'll write a detail review about everything.,244
5,"Realme Buds T300 are a great choice for this price range! Here's what I observed with the unit of product I received:Charging : They support Fast Charging. The most interesting and important part about this is that realme claims that 10 minutes of charge can provide around 7 hours of playback which I found to be true.Mic Quality : I tested the mic quality and it seemed interesting. It apparently depends on which mode you're using these buds which heavily affects the mic quality. For example, when I call with this without Noise Cancellation on, it actually cancels the noise from my audio. But when I don't use Noise Cancellation, it doesn't suppresses the background noise. And there's this issue I'm having with the device that my phone or my PC doesn't seems to be able to use the mic of this device while I'm not in a call. Mic quality is fine.Volume Control & Sound Quality : Here comes the best part. The Bass on this thing is extremely good. You can actually make it even better by using the realme link app to change the modes on this device. All in all, it's great for music listeners. This product is recommended if you're looking for a good music listening experience at the this price range.Appearance : There is no doubt that this thing looks absolutely professional. It has a really sleek design and it feels very smooth when you hold it.Build Quality : I don't know if it's just me but I feel like the build quality of this thing isn't that good. Especially the lid of the case. When I open the case, I have a feeling that the lid might break if I push it a bit too hard. Of course, that wouldn't happen and I tried it. The lid of the case, overall feels a bit loose. I don't know if that's a defect in the unit I got or is it the standard. Either way, I'm not really satisfied with this defect.Button Control : There is a button to control media on this device. There are three possible combinations that one can use on both the sides of the earbuds. It comes with defaults but you can configure the buttons in the realme link app. I personally found the usage of buttons quite limited. But it's good for simplicity of controls.Noise Cancellation : BY FAR, THE BEST PART. Personally, I'm someone who comes from a community that uses headphones a lot. I have one wired headphones with me which used to be my main before I got this. I have ALWAYS wanted Noise Cancellation and since I used headphones that didn't support it. It was a big thing for me. This was the best part in my opinion of these earbuds. They support upto -30db of Noise Cancellation and it actually works damn well. To get Ambient Noise Cancellation in this budget is quite crazy.Bluetooth 5.3 : It has Bluetooth 5.3 and Wake & Pair and in my opinion, it works pretty well.IP55 Rating : It has a rating of IP55 so it's resistant from water splashes/sweat and light amount of dust. Of course, I had to test it and it seems that it really is resistant to water splashes and dust. I tested it in such environments and it still works great. No problemo.Dolby Atmos : It also has Dolby Atmos which, personally, I didn't notice that much but when I was testing this feature, I shifted my focus to the 360¬∞ audio and it surely seemed like it works and pretty well at that. It could be my imagination though so don't take my word for it here.App : You can use realme link app to further configure the settings of this device and it's pretty decent. You get options to change audio modes, button functionality, etc. So it's pretty decent.In conclusion, I think that these earbuds are extremely good for their price range and you should definitely go for it if you're a music lover or you just need earbuds for day-to-day tasks.I hope my review was helpful to the readers. Thank you for your quality time!",Really Good Earbuds!!!,254
5,"Ordered during Great Indian Festival.Effective price after SBI Discount was Rs. 2250/-I ordered this product after thorough research.And I am happy that for this price, it exceeds my expectations.Design - Similar to Nord Buds the first. But, both the gray and white colors have some faint dotted design over the case and the stem of the buds. Faint flue dots over white. I was not prepared for that, at first glance, it looks a little dusty but can be overlooked.Both the case and buds are very lightweight and easy to carry.However, what I found to be a downside is that the buds dont have any magnetic attraction between them, so while they're easy to place in the case, outside the case they can't be clubbed together.Fit - Fits perfectly. No pain/discomfort. When I move my head from side to side, they stay put. I ran on the treadmill for a few minutes at 12kmph. They didn‚Äôt even budge. It didn‚Äôt feel like they would slip out. Which is great.Call Quality - The thing I was most worried about. And it passes the test. I live on a quiet street though - The other person is able to hear me loud and clear, and sometimes, ambient sound is also audible to them but the volume of that sound is much lower than my voice so it is not bothersome. Even in busier surroundings, no one has complained about my call quality yet!Audio Quality - I'm quite fond of listening to loud music. This does more than just justice to the loudness. I am more than happy listening at 50% volume. It‚Äôs definitely bass heavy. The quality of the sound is clear and crisp. I am very happy.ANC - It was not a priority for me, however, I did try it. Noise cancellation is definitely very effective. It does as much as promised, not more. However, there is a faint hissing sound. But it doesn‚Äôt bother me when playing some music or audio.Hey Melody - Its NOT detecting my earbuds yet lol. I'm an apple user. Let's see I'll try pairing it properly.Switching between devices - Unpair with one to pair with another. Not much of a hassle though, its fairly quick. And it automatically pairs with my phone as soon as I take it out of the case.Battery Life - Yet to be explored! I‚Äôm someone who carries all my chargers on the go and tend to keep all my devices well charged, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to face much issue.My Personal Reasons why I didn't go for Buds Z2 even though my budget was flexible -1. In Ear Detection - if it goes haywire, I don't think there's an option to turn it off.2. Glossy finish - I was afraid it would slip out.3. It was released in 2021. About time we got a Z3, no?Reasons why I wanted Z2 -1. 3 mics2. Google pairing - easy switch between devices3. More premium productAm I happy I went with this and not with Z2 - MOST DEFINITELY YES!!!",Stop overthinking & trust me on this one - does more than just the job at a budget price!,362
4,I bought this product recently. Used it full-fledged for about 10 days. I am using this product with realme gt2 pro.Lets talk about cons first1. Ear comfort of this product is ok but not  great. Using more than 1 hr ear  starts to hurt and painful. You need to  remove buds from ear and then keep  again to tackle the pain. I tried other ear  tips which comes in the box. tried small  ear tips which made comfort even worse  and painful.2 when audio is paused you will hear some  kind of gizzz sound which is very  annoying may be it is to handle outside  sound it seems. In transparency mode  gizz sound is less as you will hear outside  noise. When your not playing anything  keep buds aside or in the box donot  keep in ears. Trust me you will definitely  feel discomfort.3 ANC - Active Noise Cancellation is  working good but not great. You can still  hear outside noises. But it does have  difference. 50 percent of noises will be  reduced but not complete isolation.4 Hey Melody App. when phone bluetooth  is on buds will automatically pairs which  is great but when you go into app it still  shows select device to connect. But from  bluetooth settings i am able to select  and configure the product. I feel if device  is connected app should atleast show it  is connected.Pros 1. Sound Quality is great. 2. Bass is great. 3. Switching with between multiple device  is great as it wont automatically shift to  other device and you have to touch and  hold long to  shift and continue using. It  can be configure from app. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Having ANC in this price is great. 6. Ear fitting is great. It wont fall from the  ear.Hope this review helps..!!,Worth the price,519
4,"After 3 years of extremely rough use knockoff Chinese wireless Bluetooth earbud kicked the bucket. Earbud, because one of them still work(and people say Chinese tech is poorly made). At the time of buying those knockoff earbuds it was around the same price as these One Plus Nord Buds 2 price range, actually I believe it was slightly cheaper(I cannot for the life of me remember). I am not a heavy earbuds user, I mostly use it to listen to podcasts in the morning and pair it with my laptop to listen to music while I work at night. The buds seldom leave the vicinity of my work desk at home, no exposure to the elements of nature and no exposure to sweat. I clean my earbuds regularly. That being said I do listen to a wide range of music, I'm no audiophile, but can identify change in quality in the listening device.With that in mind, these earbuds offer an okay sound quality, hence why I gave it 4 stars, the sound quality is clear and don't have much noise, the trebles are well balanced so as to not rupture your eardrums, but the bass is overblown which is why I gave it 3 stars. The bass drowns out the other sounds, and overwhelms your ear. Especially if you are listening to an orchestral piece, you'll struggle appreciate the individual artists. This can be solved with software to a certain extent. By using the ""HeyMelody"" app you can configure your OnePlus Nord Buds 2. You can use pre configured sound profiles like Balanced, Bold, Serenade, or Bass. There is also the BassWave option which allows you to adjust the clarity and fidelity of the bass via software. If you are still unsatisfied you can configure your own custom profile by adding an equalizer and creating the ideal audio setup.Now one of the more attractive feature of these buds I have seen from other buyers is the ANC at this price point. Honestly I don't really use the feature that much, mostly because I like to be aware of my surroundings and not get completely immersed in whatever I'm doing on the computer/phone. But the ANC works kinda well? I mean it's not the same as Apple's ANC, but for 3k you should temper your expectations. By holding down on the touch gesture surface on the ear buds or by going into the app on your phone you can enable ANC. It was able to completely tune out the ambient buzzing sound of my Air Conditioning, which is old and loud, so I think the ANC is very good. The only thing is when there is no audio playing you'll hear a hissing or buzzing sound if you have ANC enabled. It's not super annoying, but that is just my personal opinion.As for battery backup, I have managed to go 2 days without charging the buds, but this is with light usage. It still has 90% left even after I have used it for 2 days so I think the battery backup is good. The case is sturdy and the buds fall into place within the case magnetically. Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and that's all I have to say about the buds.I have however talked to people that bought these buds as a part of expanding their OnePlus ecosystem, and they claim that these buds are amazing when paired with their OnePlus phone or OnePlus tablet. I wouldn't know, I don't believe in ecosystems.But people, for 3k this is totally worth the price. Haven't met with any issues till now, if I do I'll make sure to update this review. Cheers",Surprised me in the price range,583
4,"Been using this product for a week and i must say, the audio quality is remarkable, great lows mids and highs, also the bass is great too. ANC is promising, just make sure you use the earbuds pieces (idk what its called) that matches your ears and you'll notice a significant difference. Transparency mode is great too. This product also supports dolby atmos and 3d spatial sound! Touch controls too, that you can configure via 'Realme link' app.About app:The app has various configurations like battery status, sound effects mode, that include:1. Clear vocals- for obviously clear vocals lol2. Nature balance- idk what this means tbh, but from what i know, it automatically adjusts the sound depending on what is playing.3. Clear bass- best sound effect mode for bass lovers, not to heavy, not to light, just perfect (recommended)4. Bass boost- meh, i dont think think you'd want to live in a constant barrage of earthquake... its a headache (its not that strong, i think clear bass is more than enough in my opinion)It also comes with equalizer where you add various presets and create sound profiles.Spatial Audio: let me copy paste from what it says in the app.... Brand new 360 degree immersive surround sound experience, so you you feel like you're right at the center of the action.Volume enhancer: It further increases the volume and enhance its quality. You know the meaning of enhance don't you?Other settings: Game modeyes, game mode it reduces latency ofcourse! that too- significantly! good for gaming 50ms latency i guess?Find my phone: finds your phone. Let me copy paste again.... When your headset is connected to your phone, press the left or right earbud four times continuously to find your phone. Your phone will then start to ring.Button settings: double tap, triple tap, touch and hold...actions: play/pause, previous track, switch noise control modes.... you can configure these settings with button settings! i like itoverall rating: (for the price segment)comfort: 3.6/5sound: lows: 4/5 mids: 4/5 highs: 5/5. bass: 5/5 overall: 4.5/5ANC:  5/5. Best Active noise cancellation you'll get at this price right now.stereo seperation: Bad, sound is a bit inclined toward right side. I had to use the audio balance bar slider from settings to align the sound. MAYBE IT WAS MY PHONE's ISSUE? IDKlooks: small, cute, neat, and its surprisingly light weight! both colors are very good! (i have the black one) 5/5case: premium, sturdy and good build quality, fits in palm, it wont disappoint you, open and close the case, its quite satisfying. i do that when im bored. its so cute i want to eat it. 5/5Mic and calling: Nice, I really have no idea about it because i don't have anyone to talk with. Maybe look for other reviews about this?! sorry :(  ?/5OVerall rating: 4.38134124/5OTHER: just go for it my friend, if you want more in this price, well goodluck waiting. You wont find better ear-pods in this price. I bet my left ball.EDIT: Yes it was my phone's issue, the stereo seperation is balanced, i checked on my brother's phone. Also, if you are going for white color then dont forget the case for the white earpods is glossy unlike black that is matte, and the white earpods material is glossier than the black one too, i have both colors. So if you're looking for matte finish then just go for black color, it looks more premium and it looks better than the white ones.Thanks for reading!-YASH",Best earpods under Rs.2500,592
